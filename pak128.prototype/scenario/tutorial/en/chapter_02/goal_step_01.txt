<p>
We are going to set up a bus service in the town of {name} .
</p>
<p>
First, you need to build a dead-end road. This is necessary so that we can build a garage on it later.
</p>
<p>
<h1>Roads:</h1>
This tool can be used by dragging the mouse or clicking from one point to another. You can also hold the [Ctrl] key when dragging or clicking to build straight paths. There are several types of roads: their maximum speed varies between 30km/h and 200km/h. Players must pay maintenance for the roads that you build; the cost varies depending on the type of road. It is also possible to electrify roads in order to allow the passage of electric vehicles.
</p>
<p>
Open the <em>'{tool2}'</em> toolbar in the menu bar (at the top of the screen) and select the 50 km/h road tool. Then you can build a road either by clicking once at the start point and once on the end point or by dragging the mouse between these points.
</p>
<p>
<st>To move to the next step</st>, build a stretch of road between {t1} and {t2} or {t1} and {t3}.
