Let us take another step in setting up your bus service for {name}.
</p>
<p>
You need to build bus stops at each of the points marked in the city: <br/>
{list}
</p>
<p>
Stops are in the <em>'{tool2}'</em> toolbar too.
</p>
<p>
<h1>Bus Stops:</h1>
In order for the bus to be able to load passengers, it is necessary that the stops are close to some city buildings, a tourist attraction or a factory. The stops have a storage capacity of 32, 64 or more. It is also possible to combine them to increase their load capacity along with their coverage. You can also allow them to accept different types of passengers or cargo using extension buildings or by adding stops that accept those different types.
</p>
<p>
<em>Note:</em> The stops have a coverage area of 5x5 around them, therefore it is advisable to place the stops at a distance of 4 tiles. Unlike buildings, streets do not need to be covered as they do not generate passengers.
</p>
<p>
<em>Tip:</em> The area covered by the stop can be displayed on the map by pressing the <em>"v"</em> key.
</p>
<p>
<em>Tip:</em> Press the <em>[Ctrl]+["]</em> keys to hide city buildings.
</p>
<p>
<st>To move on to the next step</st>, build all the <em>stops</em> in the list above.
