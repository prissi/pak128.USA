<p>
The bridge to an outlying suburb was recently washed out, <br/>
and the city of {name} would like you to reconnect the suburb by building a bridge between {bpos1} and {bpos2}.
</p>
<p>
Bridges are in the <em>'{tool2}'</em> toolbar too.
</p>
<p>
There are two ways this can be done. You must first select the 50 km/h bridge tool in the Road Tools toolbar, then...<br/>
<em>[1]</em> You can build a bridge by clicking on one of the facing slopes (the river banks).<br/>
<em>[2]</em> You can place a bridge by dragging the mouse from a slope on one side of the river to the slope on the opposite side.
</p>
<p>
<st>To move to the next step</st>, build a bridge starting at {bpos1}.
</p>
