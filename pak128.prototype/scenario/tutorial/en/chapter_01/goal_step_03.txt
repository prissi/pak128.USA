Now that you know how to move around the map, the next step is getting information about items on the map.
</p>
<p>
<h1>Inspection Tool</h1>
This is the main tool of the game. You can use it any time and it does not cost in-game money. Once the tool has been selected, left-click on any object on the map to open its information window. It is selected by default; you can also change to it (from another tool) using the magnifying glass icon in the menu bar or by pressing the <em>"A" key</em>.
</p>
<p>
Another item to note is the world position listed at the bottom of the screen in (x,y,z) format. Warning: these coordinates depend on the current rotation of the map. So if you rotate the map, the co-ordinates of all objects on the map will change.
</p>
<p>
To proceed, first click on <em>the statue of the legendary Isaac</em> at {pos} with the <em>'{tool1}'</em>. After clicking on the location, an information window opens. You may close it by clicking the <em>"[X]"</em> in the top left corner or pressing <em>"[Escape]"</em> to close the top most window. Alternatively, press <em>"[Backspace]"</em> to close all open windows.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, use the <em>'{tool1}'</em> in the {buld_name} and close the information window.
</p>
<p>
<em>Tip:</em> You can click on the preview of the object in the pop-up information window, which will take you directly to its location on the map.
</p>
<p>
<st>Note:</st> By pressing the <em>"[Backspace]"</em> key, all windows are closed, including the current scenario window.
</p>
<p>
<st>To proceed to the next step</st>, click on {pos} and then on {buld_name} with the <em>'{tool1}'</em>.
