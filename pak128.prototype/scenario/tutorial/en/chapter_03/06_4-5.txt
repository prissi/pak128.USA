You need to transport <em>{good2}</em> ({good3}) from the {f2} to the {f3} in <em>{cy1}</em>.
</p>
<p>
{tx} Select <em>'{tool2}'</em> from the toolbar and build a goods station ({tile} tiles long) near the {f3}.
</p>
<p>
<h1>Goods stations:</h1>
<br/>
Not all stations accept goods. To know if one of the station buildings would accept goods, hover your cursor over the icons in the <em>{tool2}</em> toolbar and read the tooltip that pops up. A whole station accepts goods if at least one of its buildings does.
