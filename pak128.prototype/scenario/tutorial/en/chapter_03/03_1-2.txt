<p>
You need to transport <em>{good1}</em> from the {f1} to the {f2}, where it will be used to produce wheat <em>{good2}</em>.
</p>
<p>
{tx} Select <em>'{tool2}'</em> from the toolbar and build a goods station ({tile} tiles long) near the {f2}.
</p>
<p>
<h1>Goods stations:</h1>
<br/>
Not all stations accept goods. To know if one of the station buildings would accept goods, hover your cursor over the icons in the <em>{tool2}</em> toolbar and read the tooltip that pops up. A whole station accepts goods if at least one of its buildings does.
