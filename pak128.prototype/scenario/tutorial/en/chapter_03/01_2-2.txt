{tx} The top of the Factory Window contains this useful information:
</p>
<p>
<em>Max. ... units per month:</em><br/>
Shows the production capacity this industry has. The capacity can be increased by transporting passengers, mail or electricity to the factory, depending on what it needs.<br/>
<br><em>Production:</em><br/>
Shows what the factory produces, how much is in stock and how much it produces out of one unit of raw materials.<br/>
<br><em>Consumption:</em><br/>
Shows what the factory processes, how many raw materials are in stock/in transit and how many raw materials are needed to produce one unit of product.<br/>
<em>e.g:</em> This {f2} consumes 116% of {good1}, produces 100% of {good2} and has a max production of 1064 units per month. That means that it consumes up to 1,234 tons of {good1} per month and produces 1,064 tons of {good2} out of it.<br/>
<br><em>Consumers/Suppliers:</em><br/>
Shows factories that are connected to this one. <st>(You can only transport goods to connected factories)</st>.<br/>
<br><em>Workers live in:</em><br/>
Shows where the workers live and how many workers live in that town.<br/><br>
<em>Note:</em> transporting workers to the factory is not mandatory for the factory to operate although it can increase the production rate.
