We are writing the year 1960 and the mayor of the City New York has a great vision, a city
with a useful public transport system. So he starts to collect money from all towns in the
area, including Jersey too. After a time the bank account shows 2.000.000 for his great vision.
<br><br>
Now he is looking up for a skilled manager of the new public transport company. Quite difficult,
because nearly everyone is asking him a lot of questions. The mayor decided to create a list of facts:
<br><br>
start year:	1960<br>
money:	2.000.000<br>
inhabitants:	2.200.000<br>
cities:	~80<br>
factories:	~70<br>
public airports : 	4<br>
<br><br>
As you are the only applicant for this fantastic job, the mayor hands over the bank account.
