The visionary mayor did also make a very short list of the rules from the city council decisions:<br><br>
-- no more bridge or tunnel of any kind over the Hudson River <br>
-- you are free to build any bridge or tunnel over the east river <br>
-- city building demolition is expensive (*5 as normal) <br>
-- no more factories in future
